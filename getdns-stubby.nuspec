    <summary>Local DNS Privacy stub resolver</summary>
    <description>*Stubby* is an application that acts as a local DNS Privacy stub resolver (using DNS-over-TLS).
Stubby encrypts DNS queries sent from a client machine (desktop or laptop) to a DNS Privacy resolver
increasing end user privacy.

## Features
- Runs as a daemon listening on the loopback  addresses (127.0.0.1, ::0)
- Sends all outgoing DNS queries received on those addresses out over TLS
- Uses a default configuration which provides Strict Privacy and uses a subset of the available DNS Privacy servers
- Has additional servers available for activation in the configuration file (e.g. Cloudflare, Quad9)</description>
